# Athena Analytics Platform
## The "Athena Analytics Platform" is a new application designed to collect, process, and visualize large datasets of user behavior from our existing customer-facing applications. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the product and marketing teams to improve user engagement and drive business growth.
### This repo is not for the application this is just a scenario that gemini has created for me to learn terraform based on real life cases.
